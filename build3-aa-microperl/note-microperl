To build microperl for your target, you must first download a Perl 
version from CPAN and extract it into the ${PRJROOT}/sysapps directory. 
Place the package in the sysapps directory, because it will run only 
on the target and will not be used to build any of the other software 
packages for your target. With the package extracted, we move into 
its directory for the build. Here, we cannot use a different build 
directory, as we did for the GNU toolchain, because Perl does not 
support this build method.

 $ cd ${PRJROOT}/sysapps/perl-5.7.3

Since microperl is a minimal build of Perl, we do not need to configure 
anything. We can build the package by using the appropriate Makefile 
and instructing it to use the uClibc compiler wrapper instead of 
the standard gcc compiler:

 $ make -f Makefile.micro CC=i386-uclibc-gcc

This will generate a microperl binary in the package's root directory. 
This binary does not require any other Perl components and can be 
copied directly to the /bin directory of your target's root filesystem, 
${PRJROOT}/rootfs.

When dynamically linked with either glibc or uClibc and stripped, 
the microperl binary is around 900 KB in size. When statically linked 
and stripped, the binary is 1.2 MB in size with glibc, and 930 KB 
with uClibc. As you can see, uClibc is the better choice in this case 
for size reasons.

For more information on how microperl is built, have a look at 
the Makefile.micro Makefile and the uconfig.sh script. As work 
continues on microperl, it is expected that more documentation 
will become available.

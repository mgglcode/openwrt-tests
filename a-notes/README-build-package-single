If you want to upgrade a package without reflashing the router. 


Follow the building instruction up to the point when you have 
to make menuconfig. Select the target, then check the package 
you want to build and its dependencies. 

Use "opkg info nano" in your router to find out the depencies 
for nano. 


Then these commands for tools: 

  make tools/install
  make toolchain/install


Build the dependencies:

  make package/ncurses/compile
  make package/ncurses/install


Build your nano package:

  make package/nano/compile
  make package/nano/install
  make package/index

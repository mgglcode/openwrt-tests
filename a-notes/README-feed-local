Using the feed

  Edit your feeds.conf (i.e. /home/user/openwrt/project/openwrt/feeds.conf)

  Add a new line to access the feed (and in the case of adding to the packages 
  feed comment out the normal packages feed.)
    e.g.

    #srv-svn packages svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages 
    src-link customfeed /home/user/openwrt/project/packages

  or in the case of the second example package in your own folder:

    src-link customfeed /home/user/openwrt/project/customfeed

  Update the feed: from the <buildroot dir> (e.g. 
  /home/user/openwrt/project/openwrt) do:

    ./scripts/feeds update customfeed

  And then install it

    ./scripts/feeds install -p customfeed

  Now your package(s) should be available when you do

    make menuconfig


The downloaded sources first go to <buildroot>/dl as gzipped .gz files. 
And there they are stored and get unzipped to /build_dir . See e.g. 
<buildroot>/build_dir/target-*/ and below it you will find subdirectories 
for each package's sources.
